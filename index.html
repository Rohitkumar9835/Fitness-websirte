                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>We have all heard it many times before - regular exercise is good for you, and it can help you lose weight. But if you are like many people, you are busy, you have a sedentary job, and you haven't yet changed your exercise habits. The
                    good news is that it's never too late to start. You can start slowly, and find ways to fit more physical activity into your life. To get the most benefit, you should try to get the recommended amount of exercise for your age. If you
                    can do it, the payoff is that you will feel better, help prevent or control many diseases, and likely even live longer.

                <h3>Weightlifting</h3>

                <p>Research shows that not only can weightlifting improve your body composition and give you a toned appearance, it can also improve your overall health and make you a happier person. Weightlifting can help you burn fat, reduce your risk
                    of diabetes, prevent back pain and even help you fight depression. Read on to find out all the benefits of weightlifting.</p>
                <br />
                <p>A few years ago, the general consensus was that if you wanted to lose fat, you needed to hit the cardio hard. And weight lifting? Well that would make you look like a bodybuilder. And that’s not the look most people want to achieve.
                    <br />
                    <p>But now things are changing.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p> We’ve realised that lifting weights really is effective for slimming down because muscle burns more calories than fat even when you’re not working out. Women in particular won’t bulk up like some men are able to, but rather create
                        sculpted, toned, lean bodies with curves in all the right places.</p>

                <h3>Cardio</h3>
                <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/347134/pexels-photo-347134.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=750&w=1260 " alt="Running " />
                <p>What is cardio good for, and why should you bother doing it? Like brushing your teeth and sleeping for seven to eight hours a night, it’s one of the most indisputably healthy activities you can do.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Cardio exercise simply means that you're doing a rhythmic activity that raises your heart rate into your target heart rate zone, the zone where you'll burn the most fat and calories. To count as cardio exercise minutes, you must do the
                    activity for at least 10 minutes.</p>
                <br />
                <p>By challenging and strengthening your cardiovascular system, you increase its capacity to take in oxygen, pump blood to the working muscles, and clear carbon dioxide and other waste products from your system. Plus, as your heart becomes
                    more efficient at pumping blood, your resting heart rate slows, reducing the stress on your most vital muscle.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Long story short: cardio helps your heart and lungs function better both during exercise and at rest.</p>
