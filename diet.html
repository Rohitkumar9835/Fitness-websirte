                <p>
                    Your food choices each day affect your health â€” how you feel today, tomorrow, and in the future. The link between good nutrition and healthy weight, reduced chronic disease risk, and overall health is too important to ignore. By taking steps to eat healthy,
                    you'll be on your way to getting the nutrients your body needs to stay healthy, active, and strong. As with physical activity, making small changes in your diet can go a long way, and it's easier than you think!
                    <br />
                    <br /> Now that you know the benefits, it's time to start eating healthy by exploring what healthy choices you've got!
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b>Eat plenty of fruit</b> - To get the benefit of the natural fiber in fruits, you should eat fruit whole rather than as juices.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b>Eat plenty of vegetables</b> - Eat a variety of colors and types of vegetables every day.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b>Eat plenty of whole grains</b> - At least half of the cereals, breads, crackers, and pastas you eat should be made from whole grains.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b>Choose low fat or fat free milk</b> - These provide calcium and vitamin D to help keep your bones strong.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b>Choose lean meats</b> - Lean cuts of meat and poultry have less fat and fewer calories but are still good sources of protein.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b>Try other sources of protein</b> - Try replacing meats and poultry with fish, beans, or tofu.
                    <br />

                <h3>Why Having a Healthy BMI Matters</h3>
                <p>Is BMI just another number to keep track of? Not exactly. It can be useful in telling you whether your weight is in a healthy spot, and it also clues you in when you may be at risk for various health conditions because your BMI has fallen
                    outside the normal range.
                    <br />
                    <br /> A BMI of 30 or higher, for instance, means you qualify as obese, which can lead to:
                    <br /> -High blood pressure
                    <br /> -High cholesterol
                    <br /> -Body pain
                    <br /> -Stroke
                    <br /> -Heart Disease
                    <br /> -Type 2 Diabetes
