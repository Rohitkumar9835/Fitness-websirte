                <h3>The 4 things that will happen when you start Weightlifting</h3>
                <br />
                <img class="weights" src="https://backgroundcheckall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/weights-background-2.jpg" alt="weights">
                <h4>You'll feel great</h4>
                <br />
                <p>This point comes first because it’s so important, yet is often overlooked when people are considering the various ways to keep healthy. Weightlifting makes you feel amazing!</p>
                <br />
                <p>When you lift weights you’ll feel great for two reasons: making progress and clearing your head.</p>
                <br />
                <p>The aim of weightlifting is progressive as you strive to get stronger and stronger, and with constant practice and good nutrition you bear witness to your evolving ability to lift heavier weights. There’s really nothing like the feeling
                    of smashing through a target weight goal.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Many people who weight lift also describe a feeling of ‘heightened awareness’ which is simply your body’s way of letting you know you’re more alert. Lifting weights releases endorphins for hours on end after each session, making you feel
                    amazing.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>Your balance and posture will improve</h4>
                <br />
                <p>When training with weights your body adapts itself to new stresses, and part of this process sees the recruitment of things called ‘motor neurons’.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Without getting too technical, motor neurons are the nerves responsible for movement. They are essentially connected to your muscle fibres, and they send signals to the muscles to tell them to move. These neurons are further bundled up
                    into bunches called ‘motor units’ which, if you’ve never heard of them, are like a big spindle of neurons, all connected to lots of muscle fibres.</p>
                <br />
                <p>As we weight train, we force our body to adapt to strain, and this in turn means that more of our motor units start to ‘fire’ more often, basically making us stronger. We call this ‘motor unit recruitment’.</p>
                <br />
                <p>If you imagine it like a tug of war between you and the weight - the more people you get to help out on your side, the more likely it is you’ll win. This is the same principles when recruiting more motor units!</p>
                <br />
                <p>Over time through regular weight training, your body will get much better at activating more of these motor units, which is pretty cool because the more you are able to activate, the better all of your muscles ‘work’.</p>
                <br />
                <p>This has a big impact on your ability to balance better, and your ability to ‘hold yourself up’ - i.e. stand better.</p>
                <br />
                <p>After a few weeks of weight training, just see how much better you are at balancing on that crowded tube!</p>
                <br />
                <h4>You'll get better at moving</h4>
                <br />
                <p>Directly related to our last point, when you have more motor units working hard every day, you simply get better at doing normal movements like walking and bending down!</p>
                <br />
                <p>It’s an amazing feeling to realise the potential of your everyday movements, and how much confidence this exudes to people around you. It’s easy to think that weight training doesn’t help you with the mundane things, but it definitely
                    does.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>You'll get stronger</h4>
                <br />
                <p>We’ve left the most obvious one until last: lifting weights makes you stronger!</p>
                <br />
                <p>But strength isn’t the only thing to take away from lifting; everyday tasks like opening doors, picking the kids up, and building flat pack furniture will be performed with more ease.</p>
                <br />
                <p>It’s nice to be stronger, and in the process you’ll make yourself more useful on a daily basis!</p>

                    <h3>Structure</h3>
                    <p> The structure of Starting Strength is super simple, which is a good thing.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Complicated programs are either for very advanced lifters or for personal trainers trying to impress their clients with fancy circus exercises. They're not for you and me.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>To grow strong you just need a few basic exercises that'll load and train the most amount of muscle, for as long a range of motion as your body allows, using as much weight as possible.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Following the Starting Strength training system, you'll alternate between two workouts: A and B.</p>
                    <br />
                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Workout A</th>
                            <th>Workout B</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Squat 3x5</td>
                            <td>Squat 3x5</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Overhead Press 3x5</td>
                            <td>Bench Press 3x5</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Deadlift 1x5</td>
                            <td>Deadlift 1x5</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
                    <br />
                    <p>This reads as three sets of five squats and presses, and one set of five deadlifts. That means you'd do five consecutive squats, put the bar down, wait a couple of minutes, and then repeat for two more sets.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>The order is important, as the squats are meant to warm your whole body up, the following press lets your legs and back rest before the final pulling movement.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>You alternate these workouts three days a week, for example on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Pick any days that are convenient for you but make sure you have at least one day of rest between each day. This might sound like very little training to some but trust me with this program you absolutely can not skip the rest days.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Two example weeks could look like this:</p>
                    <br />
                    <h4>Week 1</h4>
                    <p>Monday: Squat, Press, Deadlift Wednesday: Squat, Bench, Deadlift Friday: Squat, Press, Deadlift</p>
                    <br />
                    <h4>Week 2</h4>
                    <p>Monday: Squat, Bench, Deadlift Wednesday: Squat, Press, Deadlift Friday: Squat, Bench, Deadlift</p>
                    <br />
                    <h4>Week 3</h4>
                    <p>Start over with Workout A: Squat, Press, Deadlift. Simply just do one after the other.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Of course, you could pick Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday for your training days if you wanted to. Or Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday. As long as you have at least one day in between training days, so your body has time to recover and
                        actually grow stronger.</p>
                    <br />

                    <h3>Progression</h3>
                    <p>Start with the empty bar. It might feel silly but chewing off more than you can handle is only stupid.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Start with the empty bar. It might feel silly but chewing off more than you can handle is only stupid.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>You'll initially be squatting and deadlifting three times per week, which is probably way more than you're used to. Every session will use pretty much all the muscles in your body and so you'll be thankful for the adjustment period.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>If you really want to start with heavier weights, because you have some decent experience lifting heavy and often, then you should know your 5RM. Start at 20% less than that.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Once you've established your starting point, you'll start adding weight.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Like I said before, Starting Strength uses linear progression. In this context that means you'll add weight every training session and thus try to keep even steps with your increasing strength.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Some programs use complex periodization, with high volume days, low intensity weeks, max effort sets, and so on. Starting Strength has none of that you lift and you add weight.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>The lifts improve differently from each other and between lifters. Normally the squat and the deadlift will increase at the same speed, with the deadlift slightly ahead, while the press and the bench will follow each other at a slower
                        pace.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>In the beginning you'll add maybe 10 kg after each successful squat and deadlift session and 5 kg after each press and bench. So if you successfully (with good technique) squat three sets of five reps at 60 kg, then you add weight
                        till next squat session and try at maybe 70 kg.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>If instead you fail the three sets, you try again next time. Unless you fail more than once, in which case it might be time for a deload (see below).</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>When the weights are getting heavier and you're struggling to add that much, you'll start adding less. Squat and deadlift get 5 kg increases, while the press and bench get 2.5 kg increases.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Later, even that will become tough and you'll have to start increasing by 2.5 kg and 1 kg respectively.</p>
                    <br />

                        <strong>Power Hypertrophy Upper Lower (PHUL) Workout</strong>
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>The PHUL workout is based around the basic principles of strength and size. This 4 day program will allow you to maximize results on both fronts in an easy adaptable routine built off the following principles:</p>
                    <br />
                    <p><strong>Frequency</strong>. Studies have shown muscle protein synthesis (MPS) to be elevated for up to 48 hours after training. That would make it ideal for you to hit each muscle more frequently than a typical once per week split.
                        The PHUL program is designed to hit each muscle group twice within a week.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p><strong>Compounds</strong>. The PHUL program focuses on the big compound movements for optimal progression. While isolation movements are included in this program as well, the main goal is to increase performance on the main lifts,
                        as well as pack on pounds of muscle.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p><strong>Power</strong>. This program uses 2 of it's 4 working days to focus on pure strength training. The key to getting stronger and bigger is to utilize progressive overload and time under tension. These 2 days will see that you'll
                        be able to use more weight on your hypertrophy days.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p><strong>Hypertrophy</strong>. In addition to 2 power days, your other 2 days on the PHUL program will focus on hypertrophy bodybuilding style training. This way, not only will you be seeing strength increases but you'll be building
                        size as well.</p>
                    <h4>
                        <br /> PHUL Notes:
                    </h4>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Sets and Reps</strong> - When first beginning this program it is suggested to start with a lower amount of total volume until you become accustomed to the workload.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Failure</strong> - Failure is a tool that should not be abused. All sets should be completed with at least 1 rep "left in the tank." Meaning you should struggle to complete your heavier sets, but not to the point where
                            you're unable to get your goal reps.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Exercise Selection</strong> - Main compounds should remain unchanged, however substitutions can be made for like exercises if desired.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Abdominals</strong> - Ab work can be done at the end of training or on off days.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Running</h3>
                    <p>I recommend that anyone new to running use a total of 1600 meters per workout, three times a week for one full cycle of training. You will not run a mile outright. Instead you will run between 100-400m, several times, adding up to
                        1600m. There are obviously different ways of doing this, and an infinite amount of possibilities.</p>

                    <p>If you are new to running, I recommend running three days/week. It's ok if you feel slow, awkward and like you are wearing Herman Munster boots; it will pass. As with any new conditioning or physical endeavor, I recommend trimming
                        your training down until your body adapts to the new stress. Running seems to affect your strength levels more than any other conditioning endeavor - at first. Once your body adapts, you'll be fine. Millions of athletes have run,
                        lifted and achieved great levels of strength. </p>
